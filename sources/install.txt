Ubuntu and friends
==================

On Ubuntu you can easily install all the requirements using apt-get with::

    sudo apt-get install python-qt4 ipython python-matplotlib

If you are running a different flavour of GNU/Linux, like Fedora for example, just install 
the requirements with your package manager, then go to the `Package Install`_.

Mayavi SVN
==========

Neuronvisio takes advantage of some of the new features which are only present in 
Mayavi SVN ATM.

`How to install Mayavi from SVN`_.

.. _How to install Mayavi from SVN: http://code.enthought.com/projects/mayavi/docs/development/html/mayavi/installation.html#the-bleeding-edge-svn

On Ubuntu you will need to install manually these two modules: `python-vtk python-configobj`::

    sudo apt-get install python-vtk python-configobj

Mac OS X
========

Install the PyQt4_

.. _PyQt4: http://www.riverbankcomputing.co.uk/software/pyqt/download

To get ipython, mayavi and matplotlib it's higly suggested to get a 
prepackaged scientific python distribution

Some pointers:
 
- Enthought Distribution: http://www.enthought.com/products/epd.php
- Scipy SuperPack: http://macinscience.org/?page_id=6

The last one is maybe missing mayavi2. Follow the instruction on `mayavi doc_` to install it

.. mayavi doc: http://code.enthought.com/projects/mayavi/ 
 
Then move to `Package Install`_.
